ros-kinetic-ainstein-radar-filters (1.0.1-1xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Refactor filters into separate subpkg, fix bug
    Created subpackage ainstein_radar_filters for radar filters and
    conversions, moved all filters from ainstein_radar_drivers into this
    subpkg and tested build and launch on rosbag data.
    Also fixed a small bug in the radar data range filter in which the
    dynamic reconfigure callback was not being registered, preventing the
    filter from working. Now, the filter compiles and works properly.
